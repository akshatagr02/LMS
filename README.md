# 📚 Library Manager with E-Cards 💳  

A modern Library Management System designed to simplify book and student management while introducing **E-Cards** — a digital replacement for traditional library cards.

## 🚀 Overview  

This project provides an easy-to-use interface for librarians and students to manage:  
- Student records  
- Books (add, issue, return)

Unlike the traditional systems, this version integrates **Library E-Cards** — each student is assigned **6 E-Cards** that can be used to issue books. This digital approach removes the hassle of managing physical cards, reducing manual work for librarians and improving overall efficiency.
